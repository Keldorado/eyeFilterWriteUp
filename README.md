#eyeFilter

I am passionate about music and have a background in software development. In an effort to fuse these areas of interest, I am motivated in empowering musicians through software developments.

With the help of Kyle McDonalds haarcascade_eye.xml, this program allows musicians to filter sound waves with eye movement.  

The goal of designing this program is to empower musicians to think outside of traditional instrumentation and to provide musicians with the ability to control music through an alternative medium; freeing them from the limitations of traditional instrumentation and providing them the ability to manipulate sound waves in a hands-free manner.
